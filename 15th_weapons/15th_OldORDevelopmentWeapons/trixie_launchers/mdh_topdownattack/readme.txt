MDH topDownAttack
=====================



This addon enable the ablility to make Topdown attacks with the short Titan Missile launcher. The gameinternal lockonmethod is disabled and replaced by a own one which allows to attack also with the topdown mode.


Why:
-I missed the posibility to hit hald hidden targets behind buildings
-I also missed the posibility to lock on infantry and Helo's
-I really miss ACE
